I have written a short post mortem on the whole thing. 
http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/08/22/escape-deletion-post-mortem/ 

My start and end screens were unfinished, so directions are - use the arrow keys to move, esc to exit from the game, spacebar after you die. Don't touch anything. Don't let anything touch you. Get to the end of each level.

Code is, of course, Ludum Dare quality. 

Built using ruby 1.9.2 and gosu 0.7.33. If I were a *real* man, I would have a bundler file for you. Alas!


2015 update

I'm pushing this up to github on the off chance that it might be useful
to someone. As much as I'd like to go in and clean up a few things, I'm
not going to. At least not at this time.

It should run as-is on Apple, using the Escape.app bundle. It will
probably run via Ruby command line, but not having a gemfile means
figuring out the dependencies will be trial and error. Fun!
